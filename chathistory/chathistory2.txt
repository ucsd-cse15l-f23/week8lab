[Onat]: Hey guys, have do you know why the chicken crossed the road?

[Edwin]: Was it late to class?

[Joe]: To get to the other side?

[Onat]: No, to escape the Ministry of Silly Walks! 😄

[Edwin]: And did you hear about the lumberjack who wanted to be a dentist?

[Onat]: Nope, what happened?

[Edwin]: He got tired of the daily grind! 🌲😁

[Joe]: That's a good one, Edwin! But let me tell you about the time I tried to buy a shrubbery for my garden...

[Onat]: A shrubbery, you say? Did the Knights Who Say "Ni" give you a hard time?

[Joe]: They did! They demanded a sacrifice of... a herring! 🐟

[Edwin]: Well, that's not too bad. At least they didn't ask for a dead parrot. 🦜

[Onat]: Ah, the dead parrot sketch! I love how they could turn the most ordinary situations into comedy gold.

[Joe]: Absolutely! It's like their humor is a cross between a witty intellectual and a three-headed knight!

[Joe]: Agreed! Now, let's not be too silly and get back to work before we end up in a sketch ourselves. 😄
